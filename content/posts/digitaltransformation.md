Is there anything more basic in business than **price** and **position**? *Digital transformation* **changes** how your customer's perception of *how you price* (as well as your price). It also changes your market positioning. 

A company may well launch into digital transformation in order to deal with supply chain problems and to reduce costs. But it would be best to **start with value** by evaluating price and position, because that is always going to be at the core of any digital transformation.

So how does the **mainstream writing** on pricing and positioning deal with digital transformation?

The **three classics on pricing** only marginally deal with digital transformation.

**Thomas A. Nagle**'s ["The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing, 6th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Tactics-Pricing-growing-profitably-dp-1138737518/dp/1138737518/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) really started the whole approach of looking for differentiation and value-based pricing. Nagle developed his ideas especially through **industrial** products, far removed from retail and end-customer markets. Alhtough Nagle touches to some extent upon digital transformation, the core ideas of "The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing" are **pre-digital**. (Disclosure: the author originally studied pricing with Nagle.)

**Hermann Simon**, founder of the leading pricing consultancy Simon-Kucher explains ["Why Pricing is Not Primarily About Price"](https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/podcast/why-pricing-is-not-primarily-about-price/), points out that **differentiation and value** come before price. Simon's classic ["Pricing in the Digital Age"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHT3bI3UkV8) does address some of the key innovations in pricing that come with **digital products**, although Simon does **not** directly address **digital transformation**.

**Madhavan Ramanujam**'s ["Monetizing Innovation"](https://www.amazon.com/Monetizing-Innovation-Companies-Design-Product-ebook/dp/B01F4DYY1I/ref=pd_sbs_4/140-1375818-0814438?pd_rd_w=wOS5s&pf_rd_p=690958f6-2825-419e-9c16-73ffd4055b65&pf_rd_r=SRXWHWD2W4P6DBW0XJ6C&pd_rd_r=3b11a6eb-bf55-4436-a3be-5453e75f521a&pd_rd_wg=HLBoX&pd_rd_i=B01F4DYY1I&psc=1) is based on experience with 150+ projects for pricing consultancy Simon-Kucher, Ramanujam advocates putting **pricing first** before everything else: "....the root of all innovation evil is the failure to put the customerâ€™s willingness to pay [WTP] for a new product at the very core of product design." ["It's Price Before Product. Period"](https://review.firstround.com/its-price-before-product-period). This is an important point (72% of innovations fail to monetize) but Ramanujam's focus is **not digital transformation per se***.

On the **positioning side**, the mainstream writing again largely pre-dates the notion of "digital transformation."

The classic mainstream writing on positioning is Philip **Kotler** and Kevin **Keller**, "Marketing Management,"which introduced the idea of the **"marketing mix"** and the **"4 P's"** (price, position, placement, product). Now in its 16th edition, the text has been updated to include modern company examples but the work pre-dates the notion of "digital transformation" as it affects positioning.

Also frequently thought of, naturally, is the Al **Ries** and Jack **Trout's** [Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). Again, it's great writing -- especially great anecdotes on positioning -- but largely pre-digital.

There is a lot to be learned on positioning from 
April **Dunford's** ["Obviously Awesome: How to Nail Product Positioning so Customers Get it, Buy it, Love it"](https://www.amazon.com/Obviously-Awesome-Product-Positioning-Customers-ebook/dp/B07PPW5V9C/ref=pd_sbs_1/140-1375818-0814438?pd_rd_w=Tgts9&pf_rd_p=690958f6-2825-419e-9c16-73ffd4055b65&pf_rd_r=0ZX606GWWASKM6278BYQ&pd_rd_r=5a857157-a13f-44dc-8e78-c38cc42b1df4&pd_rd_wg=MCIb1&pd_rd_i=B07PPW5V9C&psc=1). It takes off from experience determining positioning for new product from both large and startup **enterprise software** companies. In each case, it starts by looking at **competitors as the frame of reference** for how customers will perceive positioning. The  perspective, however, is really positioning of **new products**, rather than the impact of digital transformation on positioning entire business.

The **leading consultancies** are the ones that have been really dealing with **digital transformation head on**. Firms like McKinsey, Bain, EY, Deloitte, PwC, and also the software-oriented consultancies, such as AIM Computing and Slalom Consulting, all have a lot to say about digital transformation. How do they look at price and position in that context?
