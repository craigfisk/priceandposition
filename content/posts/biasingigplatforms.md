At Marmalade AI, our basic idea was to create a virtual network. Why? Well, our watch word is to be accurate, automatic, and appropriate. The reality was that when we set out to model freelancers, one thing that quickly became evident was that a person's work and education background were sort of irrelevant. People describe interests and expertise in their profiles, because that is what they will be hired for. 

At the same time, another thing that became evident in looking at tech freelancer profiles was that this is a young, multicultural demographic. Yes, there are older freelancers, too. The tendency, however, is for a 30-something group in areas like digital marketing, machine learning, and UX design. These are specialists; not generalists. A freelancer can do in a fraction of the time what a generalist could do.

Also, younger freelancers are very attuned to avoiding bias. Their sense of self-worth is based on expertise. They not only would prefer to not be *corporate*. They are living in the "post-bro" era. That was where people hired people they knew into their companies. Not so with freelancers.

So what's the situation with two-sided marketplaces? They are in effect one-sided. They put the freelancer in a silo. Some even vet freelancers for the people hiring them. What's in it for the freelancer? Not much. The reward for putting a lot of work into qualifying in the platform's filter is to be commoditized and paid less.

Meanwhile, the data show that the younger the developer, the shorter the time in a company -- down to 1.5 years for people in their twenties. [Younger engineers > less time in a company](https://hackerlife.co/blog/san-francisco-large-corporation-employee-tenure). 
It looks like there is less and less distance between younger developers who are in a company and those who are freelancers.
