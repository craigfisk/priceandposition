At [Marmalade AI](https://marmalade.ai), a pre-seed startup, our basic idea was to create a **_virtual network_**. Why? Well, our watch word is to be "accurate, automatic, and appropriate." Notice **that does not include whether you actually know the person or not.** That's the old model. In the _virtual_ approach, it's not who you know anymore.

When we set out to model tech freelancers (especially tech freelancers), one thing that quickly became apparent was that a person's work and education background were sort of irrelevant. People -- especially tech freelancers -- describe interests and expertise in their **profiles**, because that is what they will be hired for.

At the same time, another thing that became evident in looking at tech freelancer profiles was that this is a **young, multicultural demographic**. Yes, there are older freelancers, too. The tendency, however, is for a 30-something group in areas like digital marketing, machine learning, and UX design. These are **specialists**; not **generalists**. A freelancer can do in a fraction of the time what a generalist could do.

This group of younger freelancers is very **attuned to avoiding bias**. Their sense of self **values expertise**. They not only would prefer to not be _corporate_. They actually are living _after_ the "hire people you know" era. In that era, people hired people they knew into their companies. Not so with freelancers.

What about **two-sided freelancing marketplaces**? It turns out they are really _one-sided_. They're a platform for corporate buyers to find freelancers by testing, pre-qualifying, or otherwise vetting them, but in the process it puts the freelancer into a **silo**.

Of course, this is what the **corporate buyers** are paying the "two-sided" platform to do. And as a freelancer, you sort of have to be there, because everybody else is there. What choice do you have?

Interestingly, the **data show** that the younger the developer, the shorter the stay in a given company -- almost like freelancers -- down to **1.5 years** for people in their twenties. See ["Younger engineers > less time in a company"](https://hackerlife.co/blog/san-francisco-large-corporation-employee-tenure).
It looks like there is less and less distance between younger **employees** and **freelancers**.
